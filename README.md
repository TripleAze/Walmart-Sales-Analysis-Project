 Walmart Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Walmart's sales data to uncover valuable insights into customer preferences, branch performance, and sales trends. Using **SQL** as the primary analysis tool, the project addresses key business questions related to **revenue**, **seasonal trends**, **product performance**, and **customer demographics**. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help Walmart optimize its operations and improve customer satisfaction.

## Objectives

- **Identify top-performing branches** and their contributions to overall revenue.
- **Analyze customer purchase behavior** and preferences based on product categories and demographics.
- **Uncover seasonal trends** and patterns in sales.
- **Explore correlations** between customer satisfaction ratings and spending behavior.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Database Management System:** MySQL
- **Programming Language:** SQL

## Dataset

The dataset contains sales records from multiple Walmart branches, including fields such as:

- **Invoice ID:** Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Branch:** The branch where the transaction occurred.
- **Customer Type:** Whether the customer is a member or a walk-in.
- **Gender:** Customer gender.
- **Product Line:** The category of products purchased.
- **Total:** Total amount spent per transaction.
- **Date:** Transaction date.
- **Rating:** Customer rating for the service.

## Key Questions Addressed

### Branch Performance

- Which branch generates the highest revenue?
- How does the performance of branches compare based on customer feedback?

### Customer Insights

- What are the spending patterns of male versus female customers?
- Which customer type (Member/Non-Member) contributes the most to revenue?

### Product Analysis

- Which product lines are most popular?
- How does revenue from different product lines vary?

### Seasonal Trends

- Which months experience the highest sales?
- Are there any specific patterns or trends in customer purchases over time?

### Customer Satisfaction

- Is there a correlation between customer spending and satisfaction ratings?
- Which factors influence higher customer ratings?

## SQL Queries Breakdown

The project includes several SQL queries organized into logical sections:

### 1. Branch Performance

- Revenue and average rating per branch.
- Identifying the top-performing branch.

### 2. Customer Demographics

- Spending analysis based on gender.
- Contribution of members versus non-members to overall sales.

### 3. Product Analysis

- Revenue generated by each product line.
- Popularity ranking of product categories.

### 4. Seasonal Trends

- Identifying peak seasons for Walmart sales.

### 5. Customer Satisfaction

- Average ratings for transactions based on spending tiers.
- Exploring patterns between ratings and revenue.

## Future Work

- **Visualization:** Creating dashboards in Power BI to visualize key insights.
- **Predictive Analysis:** Using machine learning techniques to predict future sales trends.
- **Enhancing Queries:** Adding more complex joins and subqueries for deeper insights.
